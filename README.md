# pachelbel-9000-cannon
The code for a super-cannon I made, with lights, party poppers and fire


It needs my flotilla-easy python library (https://github.com/archieroques/flotilla-easy) 
and also Pimoroni's mote python lib (at https://github.com/pimoroni/mote). 


I used a modded air freshner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_3kqcmb0vs) and Pimoroni's Mote and Flotilla lines for the lighting
and a motor to trigger a party popper.

#This project involves fire. Fire is dangerous. Don't be silly.
